# AyurDietOS
A cloud-based Ayurvedic diet intelligence and patient management system with comprehensive nutrient analysis for dietitians.

---

## Overview
AyurDietOS is a cloud-based platform designed to help Ayurvedic dietitians create personalized diet plans for patients. It combines modern nutrient analysis with traditional Ayurvedic principles like Rasa (taste), Guna (qualities), Virya (potency), and Dosha effects to generate balanced and holistic diet charts.

Currently, Ayurvedic diet charts are often handwritten and manually managed, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. AyurDietOS aims to simplify this process by providing:

- Patient profile management including health parameters and dietary habits
- A food and recipe database with nutrient and Ayurvedic data
- Automated diet chart generation tailored to individual needs
- Printable diet charts for patient guidance

This project is intended as a **final-year major project** to demonstrate a comprehensive solution for Ayurvedic diet management and practice efficiency.

## Goal
The goal of AyurDietOS is to create a **user-friendly, cloud-based platform** that allows dietitians to efficiently manage patient information, generate Ayurvedic-compliant diet plans, and provide accurate nutritional guidance â€” all in one centralized system.
